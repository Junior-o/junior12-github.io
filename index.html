    <h2>Narrative and Impact</h2>
    <p>

        Narratives are stories, and stories have a unique ability to capture our attention and imagination.  They allow us to connect with characters and situations on an emotional level, even if they are fictional.
        
        Narratives can be factual, like historical accounts or biographies, or fictional, like novels or movies. Regardless of form, they all present a sequence of events with a beginning, middle, and end.
    </p>
    
    <p>
        Narratives can have a profound impact on individuals and society as a whole. They can:

        Change our minds:
    
    Stories can expose us to new ideas and perspectives, which can lead us to question our existing beliefs.
    Influence our behavior: Narratives can inspire us to take action or make changes in our lives. For example, a story about overcoming adversity might motivate someone facing their own challenges.
    Build empathy: By following the struggles and triumphs of characters, we can learn to understand and care about people who are different from us.
    Shape culture: Narratives can reflect and reinforce cultural values, or they can challenge them and propose new ways of thinking.
